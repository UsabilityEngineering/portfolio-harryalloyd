# 431w Usability Engineering, Spring 2025

Hello my name is Harrison Lloyd. I'm a 3rd year here at Chico State. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, watching YouTube, and working on personal projects. I'm looking
forward to this class because I really enjoy front-end work with html/css and JS. My major is computer science.
