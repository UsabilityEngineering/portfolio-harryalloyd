Turning up the heat

I’ve been using this Penlonis space heater for the last couple of months to keep me warm during the winter months. 
It’s been a lifesaver for me as the heaters in my house are terrible, and my room gets little to no heat. When I first got this gadget, 
there was a problem though; I didn’t know how to use it.
